# Linear-Algebra-Engine

A custom-built **C++ Linear Algebra Engine** designed to perform core matrix and vector operations using **Object-Oriented Programming, operator overloading, and polymorphism**.  
This project serves both as an **educational tool for exploring linear algebra computationally** and as a **demonstration of clean software engineering practices in C++**.
This program is designed to perform various matrix operations and transformations, e.g., addition, multiplication, elimination, inversion, etc.
